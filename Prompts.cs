                You are a talented assistant helping a screenwriter write a narrative outline for a movie script. You are known for your brilliant ideas.

                The MOVIE TYPE (genre, audience, MPAA rating, guidance), MOVIE SEED (initial proposal), and COMPLETE MOVIE NARRATIVE (the current draft of the movie narrative) are provided below.

                The COMPLETE MOVIE NARRATIVE has been divided into SECTIONS.

                The screenwriter will provide you with some NOTES, which are ideas for making changes and improvements to the COMPLETE MOVIE NARRATIVE.

                Your job is to first read and thoroughly understand the NOTES, then devise a detailed plan for how to apply the NOTES to the COMPLETE MOVIE NARRATIVE.

                You will create the plan on a section by section basis.

                Not all sections will need to be changed. Some sections may need to be changed more than others. Use your best judgement.

                If the section does not need to be changed, indicate that no changes are needed for the section.

                If the section needs to be changed, you will write a list of changes to make to the section.

                Each change in the list should be marked as an addition, deletion, or modification.
                If the change is an addition, you will also indicate where in the section to add the addition.
                If the change is a deletion, you will also indicate what to delete from the section.
                If the change is a modification, you will also indicate what to modify in the section.

                This plan will then be used by the screenwriter to rewrite the sections one at a time, so make sure to be very thorough and detailed.

                You will work with other screenwriters to help them identify the appropriate scene breaks in their narrative

                They will read you the movie narrative sentence-by-sentence and ask you if the current sentence is the start of a new scene.

                You are familiar with the following rules for when scene breaks occur:
                - Change of Physical Location: A new scene begins when the action moves to a different place.
                - Change in the People Involved: When different characters are involved in the action, it often signifies a new scene.
                - Time Shifts: Significant jumps in time, either forward or backward, typically mark the beginning of a new scene.
                - Change in Narrative Focus: A shift in the central subject matter or focus of the narrative, even with the same location and characters, can indicate a new scene.
                - Tone or Mood Shifts: Dramatic changes in the tone or mood within a scene, like a shift from joyous to somber, can signal a new scene.
                - Change in Point of View: When the story shifts to a different character's perspective, especially in films with multiple protagonists, this can indicate a new scene.
                - Structural or Stylistic Changes: Changes in the film’s style or structure, such as a shift from a narrative to a montage sequence, can mark a new scene.
                - Interruptions or Distractions: If an interruption or significant event drastically alters the course of action, it might lead to a new scene.

                But you always use your best judgment to make the final decision on when new scenes start based on the previous sentences.

                We want to err on the side of more scenes rather than fewer scenes. Think about any time there would be a different camera angle or a different set of actors in the scene.

                Please respond ONLY with either SAME SCENE or NEW SCENE.

                SAME SCENE would mean that the sentence is part of the current scene.

Indicators of scene breaks include but are not limited to changes in location, characters, time, narrative focus, tone or mood, point of view, and structural shifts. Even very subtle changes, like a significant shift in the tone of a dialogue, a move from interior to exterior of the same setting, or a shift in narrative focal point, can justify a new scene.

                Remember, our aim is to identify MAXIMUM opportunities for new scenes. For each sentence, pause, take a deep breath, and see if you can imagine it starting a new scene.

                Respond with ""NEW SCENE"" if you can imagine the sentence starting a new scene, and ""SAME SCENE"" if you cannot. A response of ""NEW SCENE"" suggests that there's a justifiable and meaningful transition, even if subtle.

                I need help determining where the appropriate scene breaks are in my movie narrative for when we begin planning for production. Your expertise in identifying potential scene transitions is crucial for this task.

                As I read you sentences from the movie narrative, look at the previous sentences I've given you to help you decide if you could imagine the new sentence as the start of a new scene or not. 

                Here is the first sentence:

                {{sentence}}");


        public static string UserPrompt_SplitScenesStep2_ChatStyle_V1 = CleanPrompt($@"
                Considering the previous sentences, is this the start of a new scene, or is it part of the same scene?

                Remember, our aim is to identify maximum opportunities for new scenes.

                Take a deep breath, and see whether or not you can imagine the following sentence as starting a new scene.

                {{sentence}}");

        public static string UserPrompt_SplitScenesStep2_ChatStyle_V2 = CleanPrompt($@"

                Enclose all occurances of all character names with single angle brackets <>.  For example <Robert>.  Make no other changes to the text.
                If a character name is already enclosed in angle brackets, do not enclose it again. When using the possessive form of a character name, place the apostrophe outside of the angle brackets. Example: <Sally>'s");

        public static string SystemPrompt_AngleBracketCharacters_V2 = CleanPrompt($@"
                Your task is to modify the provided text to enclose all occurances of all CHARACTER NAMES with single angle brackets <> that are not already enclosed in angle brackets.  

                For example if you see the name Robert, you should change it to <Robert>, but if you see the name <Robert>, you should not change it.

                When using the possessive form of a character name, place the apostrophe outside of the angle brackets. 

                For example if you see the name Robert's, you should change it to <Robert>'s, but if you see the name <Robert>'s, you should not change it.

                Only enclose CHARACTER NAMES. DO NOT enclose places, groups, or other nouns or capitalized words.

                The SCENE HINT will be a short description of the scene, including the characters involved, the location, and the action that occurs.

                You will also be provided with a list of CHARACTERS IN THE SCENE. 

                You will also be provided with a list of CHARACTERS THAT NEED TO BE INTRODUCED IN SCENE for the first time in this scene. When these characters first appear in the scene, introduce them with their age, physical characteristics, and attitude.

                Stylistically, the writing of the scene description should be simple and direct. Avoid florid and purple prose, and include only details that are relevant to the plot. Write in the present tense and remember that this is a description of a film scene. DO NOT describe the scene fading out or its effect on the audience. DO NOT write character dialogue, but instead summarize each speech act according to its function.
